# Number Guessing Game
Number Guessing Game is an interactive Python program where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game offers two difficulty levels—easy and hard—which determine the number of turns you have. After each guess, the program provides feedback, letting you know if your guess was too high or too low. The game continues until you either guess the correct number or run out of turns.

## Features

- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-follow prompts make the game accessible for all ages.
